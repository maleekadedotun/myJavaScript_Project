                 The most relevant of the above marks uncovered in the search have been evaluated by us against 
                 your mark under applicable DuPont factors applied by the policy of the USPTO as follows.
                </b>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        Under the du Pont test, the first factor requires examination of "the similarity or dissimilarity of
                        the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression." 
                        The test of likelihood of confusion is not whether the marks can be distinguished when subjected 
                        to a side-by-side comparison, but whether the marks are sufficiently similar that there is a 
                        likelihood of confusion by consumers as to the source of the goods or services. When comparing 
                        the marks, "[a]ll relevant facts pertaining to appearance, sound, and connotation must be 
                        considered before similarity as to one or more of those factors may be sufficient to support a 
                        finding that the marks are similar or dissimilar." However, the analysis is based on the marks as 
                        depicted in the respective applications or registrations, without regard to whether the marks will 
                        appear with other marks, such as house marks, or other elements when used.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        In evaluating the similarities between marks, the emphasis must be on the recollection of the 
                        average purchaser who normally retains a general, rather than specific, impression of trademarks. 
                        The basic principle in determining confusion between marks is that marks must be compared in 
                        their entireties and be considered in connection with the particular goods or services for which 
                        they are used. It follows from that principle that likelihood of confusion cannot be predicated on 
                        dissection of a mark. However, for rational reasons, more or less weight may been given to a 
                        particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate conclusion rests on consideration of the marks 
                        in their entireties. When the goods or services are identical or virtually identical, the degree of 
                        similarity between the marks necessary to support a determination that confusion is likely declines.

                <p>
                    Trademarks are registered by the USPTO after a rigorous examination procedure carried out by 
                    the Trademark Examiner assigned the task of evaluating the registrability of the mark. The 
                    Examiner will conduct an independent search of prior trademark registrations and applications to 
                    determine registrability of the mark in view of prior marks, and in view of the requirements of the 
                    Lanham Act for marks in general. If the application is not immediately approved, the Examiner 
                    may issue an Office Action or more informal communication requiring further action before the 
                    application is allowed to proceed. During the this process, an attempt will be made to persuade the 
                    Examiner of the registrability of the mark and you may be required to submit further information 
                    concerning your mark, goods and/or services, or declarations relating to various facts relevant to 
                    registrability
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="exam1">
                <p>
                    If the application successfully moves through the examination process, the Examiner will approve 
                    your application for publication in the Official Trademark Gazette. Anyone who believes they 
                    will be damaged by registration of your mark will have 30 days to file an Extension of time to 
                    Oppose, or a Notice of Opposition, stating the grounds why the USPTO should refuse your 
                    registration. This is rare, but does occasionally happen. In the event that this does occur, you may 
                    then negotiate a settlement with your Opposer, withdraw your application, or enter into an
                    administrative trial proceeding with your Opposer before the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board. 
                    This clinic does not represent clients before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board or in settlement 
                    negotiations.

                    As will most likely happen, publication will close without incident and your application will 
                    proceed to registration in the case of a use-based application under section 1a of the Lanham Act. 
                    In the case of an intent-to-use application under section 1b of the Lanham Act, a Notice of 
                    Allowance will be issued, which in summary means the USPTO has approved your application, 
                    but now you must establish use in commerce to complete the registration. To prove use, a
                    Statement of Use providing under declaration a date of first use anywhere and date of first use in 
                    commerce together with a specimen of the mark as actually used in commerce must be filed with 
                    the additional filing fee. Your specimen will be examined at that time to determine, if it is effective 
                    to establish use in commerce of the mark. If your Statement of Use is accepted, you will then 
                    proceed to registration

                    If you succeed in obtaining registration, are continually using your mark and wish to keep your 
                    registration valid, you will be required to complete maintenance filings generally requiring that 
                    you pay a fee, submit a specimen of use and file a declaration of use. If applicable, after five years 
                    of use and meeting certain other criteria, you may also pay a fee and file a declaration of
